# OCEA0097

Data assimilation and inverse methods

It is required that the students install Julia (https://julialang.org/downloads/). One should also install the packages PythonPlot, NCDatasets and IJulia with the following commands to be executed inside the Julia command line interface:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("PythonPlot")
Pkg.add("NCDatasets")
Pkg.add("IJulia")
using PyPlot
using IJulia
```

More information about the installation is available [here](https://github.com/gher-ulg/Documentation/wiki/Installing-Julia).

Please follow the video tutorials about julia available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76KL8aSz0Sg and https://julialang.org/learning/
The software should be installed before the first lecture.
